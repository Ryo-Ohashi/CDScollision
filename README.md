An implementation of the algorithm used in the paper "An efficient collision attack on Castryck-Decru-Smith's hash function" by Ryo Ohashi and Hiroshi Onuki.

If you want to find a collision for the 128-bit prime described in Section 6, please enter

```
load "main.m";
```

If you want to perform for the 256-bit prime instead, please uncomment line 5 of file "main.m" and execute it.
